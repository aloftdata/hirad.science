The city of Amsterdam celibrated its 750th birthday on June 21st with the [Op De Ring](https://opdering.amsterdam) festival. One of its highways was closed for the occasion. Students, teachers and researchers of several organizations showed participants how they are working together to build a liveable future for the city.

Researchers from the University of Amsterdam animal movement ecology group presented the "Grote Amsterdamse Vogel Spel" (the Big Amsterdam Bird Game): five interactive games about birds.
